# leaflet-challenge

Level 1:

After visiting USGS GeoJson Feed page, a dataset for all earthquakes from the last 7 days is picked up for visualization. 
A Json format file data was obtained for this project. 

A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude is created.

The data markers reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color are created. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are presented with larger and earthquakes with greater depths (using the third corordinate) are presented darker in color.

Additional information about the earthquake is set to popup with mouse click. A legend is created providing context of the map data. 


Level 2 (optional):

A second set of data on Techtonic Plates are obtained from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates is then used to plot along with the original data into overlays that can be turned on and off independtly with a layer control.
